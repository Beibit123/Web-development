        <h2 class="heading1">About</h2>
        <p><strong>Japan</strong> is the <em>eleventh</em>-most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of <b>125.57</b> million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The <b>Greater Tokyo Area</b> is the most <u>populous</u> metropolitan area in the world, with more than <b>37.4</b> million residents.</p>
        <p><b>Japan</b> has been inhabited since the <u>Upper Paleolithic</u> period (30,000 BC), though the first mentions of the archipelago appear in Chinese chronicles from the 1st century AD. Between the <i>4th and 9th centuries</i>, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and his imperial court based in <strong>Heian-kyō.</strong></p>
